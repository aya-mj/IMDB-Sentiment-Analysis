# IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis
This project is a mini deep learning-based sentiment analysis model trained on the IMDB movie review dataset. It preprocesses text, extracts features using TF-IDF, and trains a neural network to classify reviews as positive or negative. The goal is to get familiar with deep learning workflows.
